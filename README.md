# fretta

Simple command line application to help you memorize the guitar fretboard.

Supports alternate tunings/numbers of strings with the `-t` flag. Tunings must be entered as a comma-separated list of
values, for example: `fretta -t "E, A, D, G, B, E"` for standard 6-string guitar tuning (the default value). 

Enter `q` to quit.
